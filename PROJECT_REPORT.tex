\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

The \textbf{Timetable Buddy} is a comprehensive lecture scheduling system designed to streamline the process of managing academic schedules for educational institutions. The system addresses the challenges faced by students, faculty, and administrators in coordinating class schedules, managing enrollments, and accessing timetable information efficiently.

This web-based application provides a centralized platform for managing lecture slots, course enrollments, and student-faculty interactions. The system features role-based access control, supporting three distinct user types: administrators, faculty members, and students. Each role has specific functionalities tailored to their needs.

Key features include real-time lecture slot management, automated enrollment processing with waitlist capabilities, conflict detection for overlapping schedules, and comprehensive dashboard views for different user roles. The system is built using modern web technologies including React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.

The project follows industry-standard software development practices, including comprehensive test planning, risk assessment, and quality assurance procedures. A complete test case planning and execution document has been developed, covering 60 test cases across various functional areas. Additionally, a risk assessment framework has been implemented to identify and mitigate potential project risks.

The system aims to improve the efficiency of academic schedule management, reduce scheduling conflicts, and enhance the overall user experience for all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem.

    \item To provide role-based access control for different user types
    \item To enable real-time schedule conflict detection
    \item To create an intuitive user interface for easy navigation and operation
    \item To ensure system reliability through comprehensive testing and quality assurance
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
The system encompasses the following functional areas:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item User authentication and authorization
    \item Lecture slot creation and management

\chapter{Literature Survey / Existing Systems}

\section{Background Study}
Academic scheduling has been a subject of research and development for several decades. Various approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple manual systems to complex automated scheduling algorithms.

\section{Existing Systems Analysis}
\subsection{Traditional Manual Systems}
Many institutions still rely on manual scheduling using spreadsheets and physical notice boards. These systems are prone to errors and lack real-time updates.

\subsection{Commercial Solutions}
Several commercial timetable management systems exist in the market, but they often come with high licensing costs and may not be customizable to specific institutional needs.

\subsection{Open Source Alternatives}
While some open-source scheduling systems are available, they may lack comprehensive features or require significant technical expertise to deploy and maintain.
