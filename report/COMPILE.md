## Report Structure
The report now includes:
1. **Chapter 1**: Introduction
2. **Chapter 2**: Specific Requirements  
3. **Chapter 3**: Technology Stack
4. **Chapter 4**: Methodology (with DFDs, diagrams, RMMM plan, test cases)

## Compilation Methods

### Method 1: Local Compilation (Recommended)

If you have LaTeX installed locally:

```bash
cd report/
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex  # Run twice for proper TOC and references
```

### Method 2: Online Compilation (Overleaf)

1. Create a new project on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
2. Upload the entire `report/` directory
3. Set `main.tex` as the main document
4. Click "Recompile"

This is the easiest method if you don't have LaTeX installed locally.

### Method 3: Docker Compilation

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/report:/data" thomasweise/docker-texlive pdflatex -output-directory=/data /data/main.tex
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/report:/data" thomasweise/docker-texlive pdflatex -output-directory=/data /data/main.tex
```

## Installation Instructions (if needed)

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install --cask mactex
```

### Windows
Download and install MiKTeX from: https://miktex.org/download

## Expected Output

- `main.pdf` (approximately 80-90 pages)
- Contains all 6 chapters with complete content

- Auto-generated Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Missing images
